Script for Autogenerating most common CTF/OSCP used reverse shells.

At the begining of a CTF or at the OSCP you get assigned a IP adress.

So to save time I have made this script that can be used to generate the 
most common used reverese shells at the start of the exam, or challenge 
to save time not having to make this later.

The scripts genereated are:

windows x86
php
asp
aspx

The script can easily be modifyed to create other types aswell.
